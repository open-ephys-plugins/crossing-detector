/*
 * The crossing detector plugin is designed to read in one continuous channel c, and generate events on one events channel
 * when c crosses a certain value. There are various parameters to tweak this basic functionality, including:
 *  - whether to listen for crosses with a positive or negative slope, or either
 *  - how strictly to filter transient level changes, by adjusting the required number and percent of past and future samples to be above/below the threshold
 *  - the duration of the generated event
 *  - the minimum time to wait between events ("timeout")
 *  - whether to use a constant threshold, draw one randomly from a range for each event, or read thresholds from an input channel
 *
 * All ontinuous signals pass through unchanged, so multiple CrossingDetectors can be
 * chained together in order to operate on more than one channel.
